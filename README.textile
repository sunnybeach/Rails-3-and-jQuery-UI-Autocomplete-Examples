h1. A few examples of jQueryUI Autocomplete and Rails 3. Specifically there are a few different examples of how to return json.

To get this to work, download the this complete Rails 3 application. 

Run the following commands to (hopefully) get the application running.
<pre>
  bundle install
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed
  rails s
</pre>

Open a browser and add a new product. The category, color, and manufacturer names will autocomplete if there is a matching name. 

To see some of the changes made, you can search for CHANGES_HERE throughout the application. 

h2. How was this app created?

The following commands were used to create the basic outline of the application. 
<pre>
  rails new jQueryAutocompleteSample
  cd jQueryAutocompleteSample
  rails g scaffold category name:string 
  rails g scaffold color name:string 
  rails g scaffold manufacturer name:string 
  rails g scaffold product title:string description:text category_id:integer color_id:integer manufacturer_id:integer
</pre>
Open the project in your favorite editor
go to db/seeds.rb - add some fake data 
edit the routes.rb file
<pre>
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed
  rm public/index.html
  rails s 
</pre>
I also made numerous changes to the public folder, most importantly adding the current version of jQuery and jQueryUI along with BlueprintCSS.
